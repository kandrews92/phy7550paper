\section{Introduction to $p$-$n$ Junction}\label{sec:sec001}
A $p$-$n$ junction is formed when a $p$-type semiconductor is and an $n$-type semiconductor are in contact.
Understanding this basic configuration creates a foundation for much of modern electronic
applications and other semiconductor devices. These $p$-$n$ junctions are fundamental to a variety of functions
such as rectification, amplification, switching, and other applications which can be achieved by varying parameters 
of the junction.
