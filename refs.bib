	abstract = {The widely used photodetector design based on atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has a lateral metal-TMD-metal junction with a fairly small, line shape photoresponsive active area at the TMD-electrode interface. Here, we report a highly efficient photodetector with extremely large photoresponsive active area based on a lateral junction of monolayer-bilayer WSe 2 . Impressively, the separation of the electron–hole pairs (excitons) extends onto the whole 1L–2L WSe 2 junction surface. The responsivity of the WSe 2 junction photodetector is over 3200 times higher than that of a monolayer WSe 2 device and leads to a highest external quantum efficiency of 256\% due to the efficient carrier extraction. Unlike the TMD p–n junctions modulated by dual gates or localized doping, which require complex fabrication procedures, our study establishes a simple, controllable, and scalable method to improve the photodetection performance by maximizing the active area for current generation.},
